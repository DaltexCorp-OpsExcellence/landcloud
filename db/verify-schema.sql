-- Farm Structure Cloud — schema verification.
-- Run against sfyjvgjwvtwkrnqrvqyc after `supabase link`. Every row must read PASS.
-- All 22 verified passing on 10 Aug 2026 against the live project.
-- Run it after EVERY migration and treat a FAIL as a blocked merge.

-- These assert the properties the application depends on and that are easy to
-- break by accident. If any FAIL, stop and report it rather than working around it.
